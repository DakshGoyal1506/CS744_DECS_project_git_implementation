# Versioning-Based File System with Snapshots, Rollback, and Diff Visualization

## Overview
This project is a versioning-based file system using FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace), featuring snapshots, rollback, and diff visualization. FUSE enables file system development in user space without kernel modifications, making it an ideal framework for this project.

## Features
1. **Versioning**: Track changes over time with a structured versioning mechanism.
2. **Snapshots**: Capture the entire state of the file system at specific points.
3. **Rollback**: Revert files and directories to a prior state.
4. **Diff Visualization**: View differences between file versions and snapshots.

## Project Structure

### Part 1: Environment Setup
- Install FUSE and dependencies for Linux or macOS.
- Set up a development environment with the required tools.

### Part 2: File System Design
- Define file and directory structure.
- Implement data structures for metadata and version tracking.
- Choose and set up storage mechanisms for metadata and versions.

### Part 3: Basic File System Operations
- Implement core FUSE callbacks for file operations like `getattr`, `readdir`, `open`, `read`, `write`, and directory operations.

### Part 4: Versioning Support
- Enhance write operations to create versions before modifying files.
- Enable read operations to default to the latest version or access specific versions.

### Part 5: Snapshot Functionality
- Create snapshots by mapping current file versions to a unique snapshot ID.
- Expose snapshots as a readable directory.

### Part 6: Rollback Functionality
- Implement a rollback mechanism to revert files to a specified snapshot version.

### Part 7: Diff Visualization
- Create a diff command to visualize changes between file versions and snapshots.

### Part 8: Testing and Debugging
- Write unit and integration tests.
- Implement logging and optimize performance.

### Part 9: Documentation
- Create this README, along with usage guides and examples.
- Document code, architecture, and contribution guidelines.

## Usage
- **Mounting the File System**: Instructions on mounting the file system and usage examples.
- **Snapshot Command**: Command to take a snapshot.
- **Rollback Command**: Command to revert to a snapshot.
- **Diff Command**: Command to visualize differences.

## Developer Notes
1. **Concurrency**: Implement thread safety for concurrent access.
2. **Error Handling**: Ensure all possible errors are handled gracefully with informative messages.
3. **Modularity**: Each part can be independently developed and tested, ensuring scalability and ease of maintenance.
